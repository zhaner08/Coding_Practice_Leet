 *
 * ‚Å†Given an integer array with all positive numbers and no duplicates, find
 * the number of possible combinations that add up to a positive integer
 * target.
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * nums = [1, 2, 3]
 * target = 4
 * 
 * The possible combination ways are:
 * (1, 1, 1, 1)
 * (1, 1, 2)
 * (1, 2, 1)
 * (1, 3)
 * (2, 1, 1)
 * (2, 2)
 * (3, 1)
 * 
 * Note that different sequences are counted as different combinations.
 * 
 * Therefore the output is 7.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Follow up:
 * What if negative numbers are allowed in the given array?
 * How does it change the problem?
 * What limitation we need to add to the question to allow negative numbers? 
 * 
 * Credits:Special thanks to @pbrother for adding this problem and creating all
 * test cases.

        //Example, if 123 and target 4, way to get to 4 is way to get to 1+2+3, so do a bottom up and the last will store the value
        int length = nums.length;
        int[] dp = new int[target+1];
        dp[0] = 1;

}
//was slow because did a sort, which we dont need, just add a condition to check if i-nums[j] <0
