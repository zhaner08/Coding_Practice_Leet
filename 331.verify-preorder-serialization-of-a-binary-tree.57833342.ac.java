 *
 * One way to serialize a binary tree is to use pre-order traversal. When we
 * encounter a non-null node, we record the node's value. If it is a null node,
 * we record using a sentinel value such as #.
 * 
 * 
 * ⁠    _9_
 * ⁠   /   \
 * ⁠  3     2
 * ⁠ / \   / \
 * ⁠4   1  #  6
 * / \ / \   / \
 * # # # #   # #
 * 
 * 
 * For example, the above binary tree can be serialized to the string
 * "9,3,4,#,#,1,#,#,2,#,6,#,#", where # represents a null node.
 * 
 * 
 * Given a string of comma separated values, verify whether it is a correct
 * preorder traversal serialization of a binary tree. Find an algorithm without
 * reconstructing the tree.
 * 
 * Each comma separated value in the string must be either an integer or a
 * character '#' representing null pointer.
 * 
 * You may assume that the input format is always valid, for example it could
 * never contain two consecutive commas such as "1,,3".
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * "9,3,4,#,#,1,#,#,2,#,6,#,#"
 * Return true
 * Example 2:
 * "1,#"
 * Return false
 * Example 3:
 * "9,#,#,1"
 * Return false

 * all test cases.
