 * 
 * Given a list of strings, you need to find the longest uncommon subsequence
 * among them. The longest uncommon subsequence is defined as the longest
 * subsequence of one of these strings and this subsequence should not be any
 * subsequence of the other strings.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from one sequence by
 * deleting some characters without changing the order of the remaining
 * elements. Trivially, any string is a subsequence of itself and an empty
 * string is a subsequence of any string.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * The input will be a list of strings, and the output needs to be the length
 * of the longest uncommon subsequence. If the longest uncommon subsequence
 * doesn't exist, return -1.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: "aba", "cdc", "eae"
 * Output: 3
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * All the given strings' lengths will not exceed 10.
 * The length of the given list will be in the range of [2, 50].
