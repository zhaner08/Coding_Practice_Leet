 * Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of
 * two given nodes in the BST.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor
 * is defined between two nodes v and w as the lowest node in T that has both v
 * and w as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of
 * itself).”

 * For example, the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of nodes 2 and 8 is 6. Another
 * example is LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of
 * itself according to the LCA definition.
