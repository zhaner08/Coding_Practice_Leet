 * Remember the story of Little Match Girl? By now, you know exactly what
 * matchsticks the little match girl has, please find out a way you can make
 * one square by using up all those matchsticks. You should not break any
 * stick, but you can link them up, and each matchstick must be used exactly
 * one time.
 * 
 * ‚Å†Your input will be several matchsticks the girl has, represented with their
 * stick length. Your output will either be true or false, to represent whether
 * you could make one square using all the matchsticks the little match girl
 * has.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: [1,1,2,2,2]
 * Output: true
 * 
 * Explanation: You can form a square with length 2, one side of the square
 * came two sticks with length 1.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: [3,3,3,3,4]
 * Output: false
 * 
 * Explanation: You cannot find a way to form a square with all the
 * matchsticks.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * The length sum of the given matchsticks is in the range of 0 to 10^9.
 * The length of the given matchstick array will not exceed 15.
