 *
 * Given two sentences words1, words2 (each represented as an array of
 * strings), and a list of similar word pairs pairs, determine if two sentences
 * are similar.
 * 
 * For example, "great acting skills" and "fine drama talent" are similar, if
 * the similar word pairs are pairs = [["great", "fine"],
 * ‚Å†["acting","drama"], ["skills","talent"]].
 * 
 * Note that the similarity relation is not transitive. For example, if "great"
 * and "fine" are similar, and "fine" and "good" are similar, "great" and
 * "good" are not necessarily similar.
 * 
 * However, similarity is symmetric.  For example, "great" and "fine" being
 * similar is the same as "fine" and "great" being similar.
 * 
 * Also, a word is always similar with itself.  For example, the sentences
 * words1 = ["great"], words2 = ["great"], pairs = [] are similar, even though
 * there are no specified similar word pairs.
 * 
 * Finally, sentences can only be similar if they have the same number of
 * words.  So a sentence like words1 = ["great"] can never be similar to words2
 * = ["doubleplus","good"].
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * The length of words1 and words2 will not exceed 1000.
 * The length of pairs will not exceed 2000.
 * The length of each pairs[i] will be 2.
 * The length of each words[i] and pairs[i][j] will be in the range [1, 20].
