 *
 * Given a pattern and a string str, find if str follows the same pattern.
 * ‚Å†Here follow means a full match, such that there is a bijection between a
 * letter in pattern and a non-empty word in str.
 * 
 * Examples:
 * 
 * pattern = "abba", str = "dog cat cat dog" should return true.
 * pattern = "abba", str = "dog cat cat fish" should return false.
 * pattern = "aaaa", str = "dog cat cat dog" should return false.
 * pattern = "abba", str = "dog dog dog dog" should return false.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Notes:
 * You may assume pattern contains only lowercase letters, and str contains
 * lowercase letters separated by a single space.
 * 
 * 
 * Credits:Special thanks to @minglotus6 for adding this problem and creating
 * all test cases.
